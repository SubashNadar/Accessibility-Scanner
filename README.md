A Chrome extension leveraging AI [or specify the service, e.g., Your AI Service Name] to help developers and testers identify web accessibility issues. It requires an API token for analysis and provides results in a downloadable file.

## Features

*   Scans web pages for common accessibility issues (e.g., WCAG compliance points).
*   Utilizes [cody/API Name or "an external analysis service"] for in-depth checking (requires API token).
*   Provides a downloadable report file containing the list of identified issues.
*   Easy-to-use interface accessible from the browser toolbar.
*   [Add any other specific features]

## Prerequisites

*   Google Chrome Browser
*   A valid API Token for **[Your Service/API Name]**. You can usually obtain this by signing up at [Link to where users get the token, e.g., your service's website].

## Installation (Loading the Unpacked Extension)

Since this extension is currently under development or not yet published on the Chrome Web Store, you need to load it manually:

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    *   If you have the source code zipped, unzip it to a dedicated folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Dev\my-accessibility-scanner`).
    *   Alternatively, if it's a Git repository, clone it:
        ```bash
        git clone [Your Git Repository URL]
        cd [repository-folder-name]
        ```
    *   **Important:** Make sure the folder you choose contains the `manifest.json` file directly inside it, not within a subfolder.

2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:**
    *   Open Google Chrome.
    *   Navigate to `chrome://extensions`. You can type this directly into your address bar and press Enter.

3.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    *   In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, find the "Developer mode" toggle and switch it **ON**.

4.  **Load Unpacked Extension:**
    *   Once Developer mode is enabled, new buttons will appear, including "Load unpacked". Click on it.
    *   A file browser window will open. Navigate to and select the **folder** where you unzipped or cloned the extension files (the one containing `manifest.json`). Do **not** select the `manifest.json` file itself, select the *folder* containing it.
    *   Click "Select Folder".

5.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   Your extension should now appear in the list of installed extensions.
    *   Look for its icon [Describe your extension's icon briefly] in your Chrome toolbar (you might need to click the puzzle piece icon to pin it).

## How to Use (Checking a Page)

1.  **Navigate to a Web Page:** Open any website or web page you want to scan for accessibility issues.
2.  **Activate the Extension:** Click on the **[Your Extension Name]** icon in your Chrome toolbar.
3.  **Initiate Scan (Requires Token):**
    *   A popup window (or options page section) will appear.
    *   You will likely see a field labeled "**[Your Service/API Name] API Token**" (or similar).
    *   **Enter your valid API token** into this field. [Optional: Add if applicable: Click a 'Save Token' button if required].
    *   Once the token is entered (and saved, if necessary), click the "**Scan Page**" (or similar) button.
    *   The extension will now likely send relevant page data to the **[Your Service/API Name]** service for analysis using your token. Please be patient as this may take a few moments depending on the page complexity and the service's response time.
4.  **Review Results (Download File):**
    *   Once the analysis by **[Your Service/API Name]** is complete, the extension will prompt you to **download a report file**.
    *   This file (e.g., `accessibility_report.json`, `scan_results.csv`, `issues.txt` - *specify the likely format*) will contain the detailed list of accessibility issues found by the analysis service.
    *   Save the file to your computer.
    *   Open the downloaded file using an appropriate application (e.g., a text editor for `.txt`/`.json`, a spreadsheet program for `.csv`) to review the findings. The file should list the issues, descriptions, potentially affected elements, severity, and links to remediation resources.

## Technology Stack (Optional)

*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   Manifest V3 (or V2 if applicable)
